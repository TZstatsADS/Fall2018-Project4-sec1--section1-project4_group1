+ Project summary: In this project, we created an OCR post-processing procedure to enhance Tesseract OCR output. We focus on post-processing which includes two tasks: error detection and error correction. We will conduct this analysis in the following steps: (1) error detection, (2) error correction, (3) candidates selection, (4) comparison between MLE and ELE, and (5) evaluation and performance measure.

+ Papers: Our assigned papers are (1) [Probability Scoring for Spelling Correction](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Fall2018-Project4-sec1--section1-project4_group1/blob/master/doc/paper/C-4.pdf) and (2) [On Retrieving Legal Files](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Fall2018-Project4-sec1--section1-project4_group1/blob/master/doc/paper/D-1.pdf).

We also want to thank Professor Ying Liu and Professor Tian Zheng for hosting lectures of Advanced Data Science this semester. It is with transcending gratitude that we announce here what an inspiration both professors have been throughout our experience of building this shiny app. Their knowledge, understanding and genuine “care” for others is illuminated in everything they do! We, Group 8, are in forever debt for their teachings. Moreoever, we also want to thank TA, Chengliang Tang. There is not enough we can say about how much we thank heaven that he is our teaching assistance. His patience and understanding are unsurpassed. We are grateful for being his students.
