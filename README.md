We also want to thank Professor Ying Liu and Professor Tian Zheng for hosting lectures of Advanced Data Science this semester. It is with transcending gratitude that we announce here what an inspiration both professors have been throughout our experience of building this shiny app. Their knowledge, understanding and genuine “care” for others is illuminated in everything they do! We, Group 8, are in forever debt for their teachings. Moreoever, we also want to thank TA, Chengliang Tang. There is not enough we can say about how much we thank heaven that he is our teaching assistance. His patience and understanding are unsurpassed. We are grateful for being his students.
